## Q&A

- Thomas: 
  I'm a junior electrical engineer working as consultant for Senegalese grid. Learning how to use open-source tools (pandapower) in my work. How is FlexMeasures different?
  Nicolas
  One difference is FlexMeasures is used for actual control

- Thomas:
  About your EV application, how does the planning update when information changes (e.g. car agenda changes)
  Nicolas:
  We wrote a [Home Assistant app](https://github.com/SeitaBV/v2g-liberty) that asks FlexMeasures to redo the planning.

- Thomas:
  When did you start and can you tell how the project is organised?
  Nicolas:
  Felix and Nicolas met 10 years ago. There is about 4 years of development in FlexMeasures.
