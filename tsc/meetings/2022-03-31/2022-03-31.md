## Discussion / Action Items

- [denied] FlexMeasures should plan for a fully-fledged UI (reason: wrong scope, at least for now, but UI tech moves really fast and FlexMeasures is about the value of automation) 
- [ ] The CLI tutorial is very developer-friendly, but tutorials showing scheduling feature through the API would be nice (TODO: open an issue)
- [ ] From our discussion for which companies FlexMeasures is useful: add qualifying documentation, e.g. FM as EMS, FM as add-on for smart decisions (TODO: open an issue)
- [ ] [denied] Put forecast accuracy front and center. Accuracy is its own focus area. We believe recognising & acting upon trends is what matters, at least for the use case in FlexMeasures of finding optimal scheduling recommendations.
- [ ] Incorporate arguments regarding forecast accuracy into documentation (TODO: open an issue)
- [ ] Tutorial showing forecasting feature through API and UI (TODO: put on roadmap)
