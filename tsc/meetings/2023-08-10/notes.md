## Notes
- Presented Version 0.15 Features (slides miss HiGHS solver
- For version 0.16, the following ideas came up:

* Documentation improvements
* More granular authentication system (ability for super-accounts to administer their customer accounts)
* Forecasting
* API modernization (OpenAPI, less legacy dependencies)
* Scheduling multiple devices: group different devices under unique constraints
* Capacity constraints as time series

No clear favorites were chosen, though.

We also discussed heating optimization in somewhat complex buildings (with inter-dependencies between heat buffers, e.g. warm water, concrete and air).
