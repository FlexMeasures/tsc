# TSC Meeting notes

All TSC meeting notes are stored here in YYYY-MM-DD.md format. Recordings and other assets from conference calls systems can also be stored in YYYY-MM-DD.XXX format.

Note there is a workflow for using GitHub issues to build the agenda for TSC meetings; learn more about how to leverage this at https://github.com/pkgjs/meet
