# FlexMeasures

In a world with renewable energy, flexibility is crucial and valuable.
Planning ahead allows flexible assets to serve the whole system with their flexibility,
e.g. by shifting or curtailing energy use.
This can also be profitable for their owners.

The *FlexMeasures Platform* is a tool for building real-time energy flexibility services, rapidly and scalable.

- Developing energy flexibility services (e.g. to enable demand response) is crucial, but expensive.
- FlexMeasures reduces development costs with real-time data integrations, uncertainty models and API/UI support.

The target group for FlexMeasures are energy service companies (ESCOs), who can build services and data integrations on top of FlexMeasures, fitting their use case and customers.
