## Notes

For the data model transition, here is our milestone, which serves as help as to what matters: A Minimal Working Developer Journey

- Install FM
- CLI: setup structure
- UI: see your structure on Dashboard -> Asset -> Sensor(s)
- API: send Data (measurements, forecasts)
- UI: see your data is there
- API: trigger forecast
- UI: see job in queue, see advice in sensor view

This leaves out the forecasts project for now. Triggering forecasts could be a part of it, of course, but this is the absolute minimum.

API endpoints are part of several projects, but for API 3.0 we should also have a new naming scheme generally aligned.
